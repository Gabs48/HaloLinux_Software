Start-up Procedures:

-Open up serial port
-Ping to ensure a good connection
-Gimbal Home
-Get Telemetry and check bytes 8-11 (or 9-12 if bytes aren't stored in an array but simply returned) to ensure that Gimbal Positions are all 0 -- for loop running to check every X.X second
-Flywheel Enable
-FlyWheel Rate to 6000 rpm
-Get Telemetry and check bytes 24-27/25-28 every X.X seconds until all have recorded 6000 at least Y times
-Gimbal Enable

-Gimbal Home -- Get telemetry to verify(while loop)

**Start Up Complete**


Shut-down Procedures:
 -Close serial port
 -Gimbal Rate to 0
 -Gimbal Position to 0
 -Disable Gimbal
 -Flywheel Rate down to 2000 rpm
 -Get Telemetry and check bytes 24-27/25-28 every X.X seconds until all have recorded 2000 at least Y times
 -Disable Flywheel
 -Wait for some pre-measured amount of time to ensure that the wheels have stopped spinning
